# tail.log
An light weight web log tail tool

### Modified from: https://gist.github.com/karmi/718035

* Fixed some errors, while node changed itself a lot.

### Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `node ./server.js /path/to/your/log`

**It's suggested to have a base authentication on your web server to prevent malicious log snooping.**
